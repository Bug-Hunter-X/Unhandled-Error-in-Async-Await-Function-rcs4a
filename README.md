This example demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await: failure to handle potential errors thrown by an asynchronous function. The `fetchData` function uses `try await` but doesn't explicitly catch errors that might occur within the `URLSession` call.  This can lead to app crashes. The solution showcases how to correctly handle errors using a `do-catch` block, ensuring robust error handling in your asynchronous code.
